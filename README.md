# Cellphone-Price-Prediction
This project involved analyzing a dataset of cellphone attributes, focusing on price, battery capacity, and various technical specifications. Using R Markdown, I performed data cleaning, explored correlations, and visualized data through histograms and boxplots. Hypothesis testing was conducted to compare the relationships between price and battery capacity. Additionally, I categorized cellphones by price range (Low, Medium, High) and analyzed their battery capacities. The project highlights my skills in data preparation, statistical analysis, and visualization using R.
